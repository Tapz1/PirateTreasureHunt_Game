# PirateTreasureHunt_Game

In this project, the agent (pirate) learns to complete a maze through the use of deep neural networks and episodic memory. I was given code for the two Python files and majority of the Jupyter file. My task was to complete the learning design of the agent to complete the maze as efficitnet as possible. 
AS a computer scientist, my goal is to uncover a problem and design a solution that aligns any business requirements. I believe that it's my ethical responsibility to ensure that my code is secure and maintainable.
